# ExtractToken
Nothing but a script that does nothing but gets your token for you.

If you want to know how it works, dip into the file and read the code.
I don't care if you include it in your other projects, and if you do...
all you have to do is simply just: from whatever_you_have_it_saved_as import extract

extract(password: str, username: str) it'll either return False or a string(your token).
